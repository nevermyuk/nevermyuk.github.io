Welcome to my space! I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate with a focus on full-stack development, driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions. 

My internship at [ReferralCandy](https://www.referralcandy.com) allowed me to work on an exciting influencer discovery platform using ChatGPT, combining AI with web tech for cutting-edge marketing tools.

Now entering the professional world, I'm seeking full-time roles that challenge and grow my engineering skills. I'm also working on personal projects, ready to contribute positively to my next team.

## Game Overview

Drawing inspiration from the legendary Super Mario Bros series, **We Can Survive** is crafted as a visually engaging, duo-player game. 
It introduces a competitive yet cooperative gameplay environment, where players are tasked with overcoming obstacles and enemies by jumping on monsters to defeat them. 
Each player strives to achieve the highest score by quickly clearing levels and facing increasingly challenging scenarios.

The game ingeniously combines elements of competition and cooperation. Players compete to outscore each other but must also collaborate to progress through the game. 
Levels advance when at least one player survives, maintaining a lively and interactive gameplay experience. The twist comes when a player exhausts their lives; 
they cannot revive until the next level, adding strategic depth to the game.

## Objective

The primary objective behind **We Can Survive** is to provide a hands-on educational experience in object-oriented programming.

TileUp introduces an innovative approach to interacting with an MSP432 robotic car, featuring a web portal that gamifies the control experience. The portal includes a real-time interface for viewing sensor data on the car, and uses color cues on the ground to dictate car movement based on the instructions given:

- **Red** - Reverse
- **Green** - Forward
- **Blue** - Left and Right

In the demonstrated example, the sensor detects the color green on the ground, allowing the forward movement instruction to execute.

## Framework Used

The project employs the MEVN Stack for its development, which includes:

- [MongoDB(M)](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database management,
- [ExpressJS(E)](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend framework,
- [VueJS(V)](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend framework,
- [NodeJS(N)](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the runtime environment.

## How it Works

HTTP requests from the VueJS frontend are handled by the ExpressJS server, facilitating communication between the user interface and the backend logic.

## Objective
TileUp offers a unique and engaging way to interact with robotic cars, providing an intuitive interface for users to control and monitor their vehicle in real-time.

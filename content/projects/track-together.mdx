## Core Functionality

### NFC and Facial Recognition Check-In
- **TrackTogether** integrates NFC technology and facial recognition (powered by MLKit, TensorFlow, and the FaceNet model) with employees' location data to offer a robust and credible check-in mechanism. This dual-approach ensures accurate verification whether employees are working remotely or on-site.

### Location-Based Verification
- Utilizing GeoFire and the Google Maps API, the app verifies the proximity of an employee to the designated office location. This feature complements the NFC check-in at office entrances, enabling a seamless check-in experience.

### Comprehensive Attendance Tracking
- The application employs Firebase to record and manage employee attendance data, ensuring HR departments have access to accurate and timely attendance information.

### Secure and Convenient Employee Login
- Employees can securely log into the app using biometric credentials or Firebase authentication, facilitating a user-friendly experience.

### Profile Management and Admin Features
- Employees can update their profiles and facial recognition reference images directly within the app. Administrative functionalities include managing office locations, approving submitted images, and onboarding new employees, all supported by Firebase's robust back-end services.

I joined Anafore to develop InfluencerCandy, an innovative influencer discovery platform powered by ChatGPT.
My efforts were directed towards integrating frontend and backend systems, incorporating new technologies such as OpenSearch to enable advanced semantic search capabilities.
I was deeply involved in the research and development, focusing on refining the product to find its market fit.
By working on developing new features and enhancing the platform's efficiency, I collaborated extensively with engineers and product managers to set and achieve crucial milestones. This role allowed me to significantly expand my skills in modern web technologies and contributed to a comprehensive understanding of creating impactful, user-centric software solutions.

During my stint at GovTech as a DevOps Engineer Intern, I focused on enhancing operational efficiency and automating critical processes. 
My contributions included developing a tool to automate compliance reporting, standardizing commit messages, automating version releases, and creating scripts to standardize Dockerfile generation. These efforts improved process efficiency, reduced errors, and streamlined development workflows, significantly contributing to the team's DevOps practices.
